    <h1> Welcome to my first blog!</h1>

    <p><strong>Here</strong>, we will explore my reasons for learning full stack development</p>

    <h3>Reason 1</h3>

    <p>Just genuine curiosity and love for <em>creating</em> and seeeing how things turn out</p>

    <p>What do i mean by that? I love learning about how <strong>data</strong> is stored in databases especially for really big apps and how the <strong>UI and Frontend</strong> change too</p>

    <h3>Reason 2</h3>

    <p>A good job scope and safety as well as pay and work-life balance</p>
